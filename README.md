Task Description: Develop a secure authentication system using the APIs listed below:

Sign-up API: Allows new users to sign up by entering a unique username, email address, and password.

Authenticates users using their username/email and password, generating an authentication token upon successful login.

Password Reset API: Allows users to request a password reset by supplying their registered email address. For verification, a secure reset link is sent to the user's email address.

Forgot Password API: Allows users to reset their forgotten passwords by entering the reset token and entering a new password.

Security techniques such as password hashing, token-based authentication, HTTPS, and input validation should be prioritized.
